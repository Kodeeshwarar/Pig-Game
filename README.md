## Pig Game
The Pig Game is a simple dice game where players take turns rolling a dice and accumulate points based on the outcome of the roll.
The objective is to be the first player to reach a certain score, typically 100. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all the points accumulated in that turn, and the turn passes to the next player.
This project implements the Pig game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive web-based interface for players to enjoy the game.

## Gameplay
Each player takes turns rolling a six-sided dice.
If a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to 0, and it becomes the next player's turn.
Players can choose to "Hold" their current score, adding it to their total score, and passing the turn to the next player.
The first player to reach or exceed a predefined winning score wins the game.
